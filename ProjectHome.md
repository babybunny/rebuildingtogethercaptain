The ROOM system manages volunteers, supplies, and expenses for Rebuilding Together Peninsula projects including National Rebuilding Day and Safe at Home.

Rebuilding Together is a national organization of over 200 local chapters which organize volunteers to fix up private homes and community buildings.
( see http://www.rebuildingtogether.org/section/about/ )

The San Francisco Peninsula chapter does about 90 rebuilding/remodeling projects each year, and numerous smaller safety and senior assistance projects.   Most projects take place on a single National Rebuilding Day:
( see http://rebuildingtogetherpeninsula.org/pages/programs_nationalrebuilding.html )

Rebuilding Together staff coordinate volunteers, supplies (like lumber, shingles, paint) and services (power-washing, dumpsters) to be available all on the same day at about 90 sites in the area.   Before ROOM was built, staff used spreadsheets and paper process which was terribly inefficient and error-prone.  They couldn't tell how their spending compared to budget until several weeks later when they processed receipts by hand.   Now the ordering of supplies and expense reporting are done online and everyone can tell what's going on.

The ROOM app is hosted on Google App Engine at http://rebuildingtogethercaptain.appspot.com/.  It's Python + Django + jQuery.

This year, I'm adding features for before/after photos of the work sites and streamlined expense reporting for HUD-funded grants, for example.
