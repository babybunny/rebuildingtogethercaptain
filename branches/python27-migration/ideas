f/b from captains meeting feb 17
  capn corner how to log in - all eyes on
  lily is nice, cari saves the day
  start 7:01
  like the fun tone
  everyone seems to get it
  a few heads turned to the signup sheet
  "afraid of the internet" got a good laugh
  preferred suppliers - yes, but they like the forms so go through the system
  free sewer cleanout, free screens
  check website for in-kind donations, even small stuff like hardware, light switches
  from brian (contractor), people are doing "de-construction" to get tax credits etc. very green, how to manage.  
    they come across stuff like windows that they don't know what to do with.  
    use freecycle, it's a yahoo group, they handle all kinds of stuff.
    whole house building supply of EPA.  limited warehouse storage, steals cycles to handle it esp. when it's tossed eventually.
    problem is one of quickly *placing* the items so they're not stored.
  appliances.  age, energy star.
